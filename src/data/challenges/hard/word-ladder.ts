  description: "A word ladder is a sequence of words where each word differs from the previous by exactly one letter.\n\nThe Problem\nGiven two words (beginWord and endWord) and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord such that:\n1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.\n2. Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.\n\nReturn the length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such sequence exists.\n\nNote: This challenge uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach - see the explainer below if you're not familiar with this algorithm.",

Explanation: The shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which has length 5.`,

  explanation: "This problem is solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. We treat each word as a node in a graph, and there is an edge between two words if they differ by exactly one letter. The BFS algorithm guarantees finding the shortest path from the starting word to the target word.",
